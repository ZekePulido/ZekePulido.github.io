Hello! I'm a **Senior Software Engineering student** at **Mississippi State University** with a strong passion for **app development** and **web development**.

While I enjoy all aspects of building software, I primarily focus on and enjoy working on the **back-end** — designing APIs, managing databases, and ensuring systems run efficiently behind the scenes.

I'm currently expanding my skill set by learning new programming languages and frameworks to become a more versatile and well-rounded developer. I'm always excited to tackle new challenges and build meaningful, user-focused software.

Thanks for visiting my page!
