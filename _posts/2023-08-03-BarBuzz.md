# Bar Buzz 🍻📅🎶

**Bar Buzz** is a Flutter-based mobile app I developed to help users discover drink specials, live music, and bar events in their local area. Designed with both bar-goers and bar owners in mind, the app provides a seamless experience for exploring and managing nightlife events.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The app was built to solve a common problem: people not knowing where the best local deals and events are happening. **Bar Buzz** allows users to:

- Discover drink, music, and event deals at local bars  
- Filter events by category (Drinks, Music, Events)  
- Explore today’s and tomorrow’s events  
- Access a full calendar of upcoming activities

It also enables **bar owners** to manage and post their events through a separate account interface.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Building **Bar Buzz** was an exciting experience that combined my interests in mobile development, real-time data handling, and UI/UX design.
