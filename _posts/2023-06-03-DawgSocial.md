# Dawg Social

**Dawg Social** was my first major project during school—a collaborative effort where I had the opportunity to lead the development team while contributing to both the front-end and back-end. This project not only challenged my technical abilities but also shaped the way I approach problem-solving, communication, and software design.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Dawg Social was designed as a social networking platform tailored for students, allowing users to:

- Create profiles and log in securely
- Post updates and share content
- Interact with others through likes and comments
- Friend Requests and reposts

As the team lead, I was responsible for organizing sprints, assigning tasks, and ensuring integration between front-end and back-end components.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used

Here’s a breakdown of the tools and technologies we used to bring Dawg Social to life:

### Front-End:
- **HTML/CSS** – Building responsive UI elements

### Back-End:
- **Django/Python** - 

### Other Tools:
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaboration
- **Postman** – API testing and debugging
- **MySql** - Database Storage

## 📚 What I Learned

### ✅ Full-Stack Development
Working across both front-end and back-end gave me a strong appreciation for how everything fits together—from data models to user interfaces.

### ✅ Leadership & Collaboration
Leading a team taught me the importance of:
- Clear communication
- Delegating tasks based on strengths
- Managing timelines and resolving blockers

### ✅ RESTful API Design
I gained hands-on experience designing routes and endpoints, setting up DB schemas, and structuring APIs with authentication and validation.

### ✅ Git Best Practices
Merging branches, resolving conflicts, and maintaining commit hygiene were all key lessons in collaborative coding.

## 💡 Challenges Faced

- **Version control conflicts** due to multiple contributors
- **Initial confusion in API structure**, which required refactoring halfway through the sprint
- **User authentication** complexity—balancing security and simplicity
- **Database Choice** started with Postgres but moved to mySql due to speed which required to refactor the entire database

---

## 🌱 How This Project Helped Me Grow

- Improved my leadership abilities with being the leader of the group
- Improved my ability to debug and test
- Boosted my confidence in public speaking and presenting technical work during final demos

---

## 🔮 What's Next?

This project sparked my interest in:
- Building more robust, scalable web applications
- Learning advanced frameworks like React or Next.js
