# Independent Learning App for Kids with Special Needs

The **Independent Learning App** was the second major project I worked on during school. This initiative aimed to provide a supportive and accessible digital learning experience tailored for children with special needs. We were tasked with creating an app that helped special needs teachers help their kids get ready for state tests.

As the team lead, I guided the development process from ideation to implementation. While I contributed to some front-end components, my primary focus was on the back-end development, where I built much of the server logic and database integration.

## 🎯 Project Goal

We wanted to create a user-friendly educational app that:

- Supports interactive learning tailored to special needs students  
- Allows teachers to track scores
- Offers engaging, accessible content with visual and audio prompts  

This project emphasized accessibility, simplicity, and performance — ensuring that the tool could serve its intended audience effectively.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Front-End:
- **React.js** – Built responsive, component-based UI
- **HTML/CSS** – Structuring and styling user-facing features
- **React Router** – Page navigation and routing logic

### Back-End:
- **Django (Python)** – Built RESTful APIs, handled authentication and business logic
- **Django REST Framework** – Simplified API development and serialization
- **MySQL** – Used as the primary relational database

### Tools & Collaboration:
- **Git & GitHub** – Source control and collaboration
- **Postman** – API testing

## 👨‍💻 My Role

### 🧠 Team Leadership:
- Organized weekly meetings and sprint retrospectives  
- Delegated responsibilities based on team strengths  
- Ensured deadlines were met while maintaining code quality

### 🔧 Back-End Development:
- Designed and implemented the database schema  
- Developed RESTful APIs for user authentication, learning modules, and progress tracking  
- Integrated front-end requests with secure and validated responses  
- Worked on data models for users, activities, and performance reports

### 🌐 Front-End Contributions:
- Helped build reusable components in React  
- Assisted with styling and form validation  
- Connected front-end components to backend endpoints

## 💡 Key Challenges

- **Accessibility Design** – Ensuring the app was intuitive for young users with special needs required continuous feedback and iteration.
- **Back-End Complexity** – Modeling educational progress in the database, including support for varied learning paths and user types.
- **React-Django Integration** – Managing CORS and aligning asynchronous data flow between front-end and back-end.
